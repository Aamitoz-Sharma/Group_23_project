    "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), or heart diseases, encompasses a range of medical conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels. Worldwide, CVDs are the leading cause of death with nearly 18 million deaths a year. CVDs  include coronary heart disease, strokes and TIAs, peripheral arterial disease, and aortic disease. Heart disease is often “silent” and is not diagnosed until a major event like a heart attack, stroke, or heart failure occurs. Early detection is key to treatment, prevention, and management of heart disease; our data analysis aims to help with this. Risk factors for heart disease include high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, obesity, family history, and increased age. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in our analysis is from the following repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease. The data was published in 1988 and collected in Cleveland. The dataset consists of 303 observations and 14 variables: age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiogram results, maximum heart rate achieved, presence of exercise induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, thalassemia presence, and diagnosis of heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question we aim to address is: can we predict if a patient has heart disease based on their age, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and maximum resting heart rate?\n"
